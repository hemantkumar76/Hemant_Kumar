# Welcome to [Portfolio](https://hemantkumar76.github.io/)

Iâ€™m Hemant, a **developer**, **DSA learner** and **CP Coder**. I can code in multiple 'languages':), experienced in writing efficient PYTHON scripts, C++ and C apps on all platforms (Mostly in vs code lol). I deeply care about building interfaces that are usable and easy to understand for the users on platforms like pc or mobile.



## About the website
Its based on **JAVA SCRIPT**  and  **CSS** mostly, the animations and effects using JS Motion. I've used some HTML codes to build basic structure which i picked up from Youtube. My complete UI process started from figma then to VS-Code
